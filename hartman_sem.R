##' Empathy Indicators
## Davis (1980, 1983) Interpersonal Reactivity Index
## 4 Sub-scales: Perspective-Taking; Empathic Concern; Personal Distress; Fantasy
## Response options 1 - 5, where 5 = "Describes me very well"
## [ept2] W22Q1_5. I try to look at everybody's side of a disagreement before I make a decision.
## [ept3] W22Q1_8. I sometimes try to understand my friends better by imagining how things look from their perspective.
## [ept5] W22Q1_16. I believe that there are two sides to every question and try to look at them both.
## [ept7] W22Q1_21. Before criticizing somebody, I try to imagine how I would feel if I were in their place.
## [ec1] W22Q1_1. I often have tender, concerned feelings for people less fortunate than me.
## [ec2] W22Q1_3. Sometimes I don't feel very sorry for other people when they are having problems. (R)
## [ec4] W22Q1_10. Other people's misfortunes do not usually disturb me a great deal. (R)
## [epd4] W22Q1_12. Being in a tense emotional situation scares me.


##' Housekeeping 
## Install and load necessary packages using 'pacman'
# install.packages('pacman')  # First installation only (uncomment and run if needed)
pacman::p_load(haven, lavaan)  # haven loads foreign datasets; lavaan is for SEM

## Check and set your working directory (Uncomment for your type of computer OS)
getwd()  # Get the current working directory
# setwd("C:/ENTER/YOUR/FOLDER/PATH/HERE")  # For PC (Note the forward slashes!)
# setwd("~/ENTER/YOUR/FOLDER/PATH/HERE")  # For Mac OSX 

##' Load the ANES Panel Dataset (from Stata; use 'read_spss' for SPSS)
anes <- read_dta("anes.dta")
head(anes)  # Check the first rows of the data

##' CFA for Empathy (Note the single quote marks!)
## 1-Factor Model of empathy forcing cognitive and affective items 
## to load onto a single latent construct
